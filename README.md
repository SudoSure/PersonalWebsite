## About Me

I am a Data Science undergraduate at the University of California, San Diego, specializing in Python, C++, Java, and JavaScript. As an Undergraduate Research Intern at the California Policy Lab, I conducted national research on generational finances, collaborating on projects related to minimum wage increases and post-wildfire displacement. My Full-Stack Web Developer role at the University of California, Riverside, involved creating an interactive campus map using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, WebGL, and Three.js. My project portfolio includes a Google Rating Prediction & Sentiment Analysis system, achieving an 81.59% accuracy improvement, and a League of Legends EDA & Prediction Model, demonstrating my proficiency in machine learning and data analysis. I've taken relevant coursework in Data Structures, Machine Learning, and Web Mining. With a strong foundation in developer tools such as Visual Studio Code and Jupyter Notebook, along with expertise in technologies like TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn, I am eager to contribute my skills to data-driven projects.
